                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <h4 class="tagline">Happiness, every time.</h4>
                        <p>Happy Regular began with a simple belief: that a good drink can change the tone of your whole day. Our founders didn’t start with a business plan—they started with late-night tea runs, long conversations, and the comfort of sharing something small but meaningful with people they cared about. Those moments of connection became the inspiration for a shop built around warmth, community, and the feeling of being a “regular” somewhere—a place where your go-to drink is remembered and your presence matters.</p>
                        <p>At the heart of Happy Regular is a commitment to making people feel good, not just through flavor but through experience. Every ingredient is chosen with intention, every drink is crafted with care, and every interaction is meant to leave you a little lighter than when you walked in. We don’t rush the brewing process or cut corners on our toppings because we believe customers can taste the difference—and more importantly, they deserve the difference. When you order from us, you’re not just getting a drink; you’re getting something made thoughtfully, by people who genuinely love what they do.</p>
                        <p>What makes us unique isn’t just our menu—it’s the feeling we want customers to take with them. Whether you stop by after a long day, during a study break, or while catching up with friends, we want Happy Regular to be that reliable bright spot in your routine. A place where the drinks are consistently delicious, the service feels familiar, and the environment invites you to stay awhile. Our value to customers isn’t simply convenience; it’s the experience of being welcomed, recognized, and appreciated.</p>
                        <p>As we look toward the future, our vision is to grow in ways that stay aligned with our core values of quality, community, and genuine hospitality. We’re developing new flavors, exploring sustainable practices, and planning events that bring people together. Expansion is on the horizon—but never at the cost of the personal touch that defines us. No matter how far Happy Regular goes, our mission will remain the same: to craft moments of everyday joy, one cup at a time, and to make every customer feel like a happy regular.</p>
